PYTHON E-COMMERCE ONLINE SALES REPORT

I’ve completed a Python analysis of  e-commerce online sales data. The dataset includes the following details:

Customer User ID
Customer Name
Gender
Occupation
State
Age and Age Group
Marital Status
Product Category
Amount
The analysis has provided fantastic insights that could significantly help in increasing sales. I’m excited to share these findings and discuss how they can be leveraged for better results.
